  "summary": "The diff implements a prompt-only fallback (REQ-3) and bundle size reduction via removing image generation code (REQ-2). REQ-4 (settings panel CSS rotation bug fix) and REQ-5 (navigation dropdown z-index fix) are not implemented. There is no evidence of a primary navigation component with dropdown menus, no CSS rotation fix for settings panel controls, and no z-index/overflow-visible changes to a nav bar.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Fix the settings panel CSS layout bug where all controls render rotated 90 degrees and overlap each other. Each settings row must render horizontally in a normal stacked vertical layout.",
      "reason": "No CSS changes or layout fixes addressing 90-degree rotation of settings panel controls are present in the diff. The index.css shows no rotation-fix rules, and ImageGenerationForm.tsx (truncated) shows no explicit CSS correction for this bug.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Fix the primary navigation dropdown z-index/overlap bug: open dropdown must render above sibling elements using absolute positioning with a sufficiently high z-index, and the nav bar must have overflow visible.",
      "reason": "No navigation component with dropdowns exists in the diff. The Header.tsx is a simple branding header with no dropdown menus, no z-index fixes, and no overflow-visible nav bar styles.",
